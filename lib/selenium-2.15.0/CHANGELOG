v2.15.0
=======
Project:
  * Code donation from Google.

WebDriver: 
  * Now supports up to Firefox 11.
  * Changed order of FirefoxProfile initialization attempts on a
    remote host: 1) try to load from capabilities, 2) try to load
    locally if webdriver.firefox.profile is specified, 3) create an
    empty profile.
  * Added the beginning of infrastructure for gathering logs from
    webdriver tests.
  * Added an UnreachableBrowserException.
  * Additional work on the WebDriver JS console.
  * Implicit waits now change how long we wait for alerts. This
    functionality will change in 2.16
  * FIXED: 2700: The infamous scrolling issue.
  * FIXED: 2816: ClassCastException when calling switchTo().alert().

Grid:
  * Grid now distinguishs between CLIENT_GONE and
    FORWARDING_TO_NODE_FAILED.
  * FIXED: issue where older RCs could not connect to a newer hub.

RC:
  * Selenium-backed WebDriver now uses atoms for typing.

Automation Atoms:
  * Significantly reworked input device abstractions.

Known Issues:
  * HTA mode for Selenium RC (*iexplore) leaves a browser window open.


v2.14.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Deleted all deprecated methods in the Java API.

    stale element reference errors when searching for child elements
    are now handled properly
  * FIXED 2917: Preventing endless recursion in hashCode.

Server:
  * Memory leak fixed

Grid:

    thrown.


v2.13.0
=======
Dependency change:
  * Selenium/webdriver java dependencies now use apache commons-exec
    (http://commons.apache.org/exec/) version 1.1. If you are using manual
    dependency management you will need to add this to your project.
    If you resolve via maven central (maven, ivy, gradle), this will
    be handled automatically.
